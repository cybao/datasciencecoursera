The output data set contains 68 columns and 180 rows (30 subjects each performing 6 types of activities). The columns are the mean of all data records for each subject doing each activities. All the data points are computed for a 2.56 sec window. The details of the columns:

subject: identifier of volunteers performing the test

activity_label: type of activity (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)
